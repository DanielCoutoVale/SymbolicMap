SymbolicMap
===========

Here you will find tools for deriving a text-analysis resource
and a text-synthesis resource from a symbolic map. These tools
are to be understood as an illustration of how a symbolic map
can be compiled into combinatory categories and into a systemic
network respectively for text analysis and text synthesis. The
whole approach is explained in the forthcoming paper:
